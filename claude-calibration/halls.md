# Halls registry

Canonical list of halls (exhibit categories). The `add-exhibit` and
`propose-exhibits` skills and the front page all draw from here.

- **opened** = has at least one exhibit.
- **planned** = reserved for the encyclopedia, not yet opened. A candidate there
  opens the hall.

Front-page display names may expand (⚡ "Async & Threading"). Emojis are unique
per hall. New halls: add a row here first.

> different worlds. Neither was opened yet, so this is a clean rename.
