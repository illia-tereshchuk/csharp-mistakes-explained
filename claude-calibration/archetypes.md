# The 7 archetypes

The taxonomy that emerged at ~25 candidates. Not halls (halls = tech area);
archetypes = the SHAPE of the wrong mental model. Use for curation balance,
tag design, and the future cross-index. Each exhibit maps to 1-2.

| # | Archetype | The broken belief | Exhibits (done + candidate) |
|--:|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Time gap** | capture/defer now, execute later - value read at the wrong moment | 0006, 0007, 0009, tasks-are-not-results, the-forgotten-task |
| 2 | **Broken identity contract** | equality / hash / interning stays stable while I mutate | 0004, lock-on-a-string, distinct-that-didnt |
| 3 | **Hidden copy** | I mutated the thing; I mutated a copy | 0009 (membership-not-values), vanishing-mutation, defensive-copy-ambush |
| 4 | **Same name, different fate** | identical syntax = identical behavior | 0002 (0.1 literal), Count vs Count(), FromSqlRaw vs Interpolated, DateTime == |
| 5 | **Silent wrongness** | it threw, so I'd know / it didn't throw, so it's fine | pervasive; the fear ladder crash < wrong < *silently* wrong. Most 😈 sections. |
| 6 | **Environment as hidden input** | GC / threadpool / culture / timezone are constant | 0003, the-collected-timer, the-immortal-subscriber, the-25-hour-day |
| 7 | **Discarded return** | the method mutated in place (it returned instead) | 0005 (throw ex), path-combine-betrayal, string methods |

## Why this matters at scale

- Halls stop scaling around dozens: `the-collected-timer` is async OR memory; `interpolated-injection` is security OR orm. **Tags + archetype are the real navigation**, halls are just the shelf.
- Balance target: don't stack one archetype. Track the mix; every batch should spread across archetypes.
- Archetype 5 (silent wrongness) is the house style, usually the 😈 section rather than a standalone exhibit.

## Fear ladder (recurring rhetorical device)

crash (loud, honest) < wrong result (visible) < **silently** wrong (invisible for months).
The 😈 section almost always pushes the exhibit one rung down this ladder, then
lands: "the crash in this exhibit is the *lucky* outcome."
