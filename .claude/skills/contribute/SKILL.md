# Guide a contributor

Someone cloned the repo and wants to add an exhibit. Make one evening's work end
in a pull request, and make it feel good on the way. They may never have opened
a PR before - assume nothing, explain the reasoning as you go, and do the
tedious parts for them.

## 0. Resume before you start

If they are coming back to unfinished work, the fastest path is `claude -c`,
which continues the most recent conversation in this folder (`claude -r` picks
from older ones). Mention it if they mention stopping yesterday.

Either way, check the disk: run `git status` first, and if a half-built exhibit
folder exists under `src/`, say so and continue that one instead of starting
over. A newcomer who just types `claude` lands in a fresh session, and the files
are what carry the work across.

## 1. Preflight (do this before anything else)

Three failures cost a beginner twenty minutes each if they surface late. Check
all of them now, quietly, and fix what you can:

```bash
dotnet --list-sdks   # need .NET 10
gh auth status       # need a logged-in gh
```

- **No .NET 10** - point them at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download and stop.
- **`gh` not authenticated** - have them run `gh auth login` now, not at the end.

Then set up their own copy to work in. Contributors always work from a fork -
nobody is given write access to this repository, and a fork needs no permission
from anyone:

```bash
gh repo fork --remote=true      # creates their fork and wires the remotes
git switch -c exhibit/<slug>    # never build on main
```

If `gh repo fork` reports the fork already exists, that is fine - they made one
earlier. Just make sure `origin` points at **their** fork before any push.

## 2. Offer the menu

Show them the **full** list of candidates from `.claude/memory/backlog.md` -
every eligible one, not a hand-picked shortlist. A newcomer should see the whole
field and choose from all of it, not from three the model happened to like. List
each candidate on one line with its hook, and tag its hall so the shape is still
readable; mark which halls nobody has opened yet - being first in a hall is the
best prize on offer.

**Randomize the order every time you show it.** Shuffle the candidates freshly on
each showing (do not sort, and do not keep the same leaders as last time), so no
candidate is perpetually buried at the bottom and two contributors looking on
different days meet a different first line. The list is long by design - present
all of it and let them scroll.

Tell them plainly: **pick the one you like most and feel most sure about.** They
will be explaining it to other developers, so genuine interest shows in the
writing. If they bring their own idea, take it - just confirm it can fail
deterministically in a single console file, which is the one hard requirement.

<!-- Internal: "full list" means every eligible candidate, but STILL silently
skip anything listed in .claude/memory/rejected.md - a declined idea never
re-enters the menu, however complete the menu is meant to be. Do not present that
file, explain it, or discuss the curation history with contributors - it is the
maintainer's editorial record. -->

## 3. Take the next number

Numbers are automatic - no waiting on anyone:

```bash
dotnet run tools/next-id.cs
```

Use what it returns. The maintainer double-checks the number at review; if two
contributions collide, renumbering is one `git mv` on his side. Never leave the
contributor blocked on a number.

## 4. Show them the shape, then draft it

Point at one finished exhibit first - `src/records/0028-with-copies-the-reference/`
is a good one: short, no packages, and the Bad/Good pair differs by a single
expression. One real example teaches the format better than any description.

Then **write a working first draft yourself** - `Bad.cs`, `Good.cs`, `README.md`
- and hand it to them to read, question and change. A blank page stalls a
newcomer; a draft they can argue with does not. Make clear it is theirs to
redirect: the domain, the story, the wording are all open, and their judgement
decides what ships.

Explain the *why* as you go - the reasoning is half of what they came for.
The detailed file conventions load on their own as you edit each file.

## 5. Prove it

From the exhibit folder, run both and show them the real output:

```bash
dotnet run Bad.cs    # must fail, exactly as the README promises
dotnet run Good.cs   # must pass
```

Then from the repo root:

```bash
dotnet run tools/check-links.cs
dotnet run tools/gen-frontpage.cs
```

Put their GitHub username in the README front-matter so the generator credits
them:

```yaml
author: their-github-username
```

Show them the new line on the front page with their name on it. That is the
moment the work becomes theirs.

## 6. Ship it

Commit under their own git identity - subject `Add exhibit #NNNN: <slug>`. Their
name reaches the front page through the front-matter `author` field, not the git
author, so their normal git config is exactly right; don't override it. Then push
the branch to their fork and open the PR against the maintainer's repo:

```bash
git push -u origin exhibit/<slug>
gh pr create --fill                 # fills title/body from the commit; targets upstream
```

From a fork clone, `gh pr create` opens the PR from their fork against the
upstream repository - they need no access to this repo at any point. Two things
that actually happen in practice:

- **If gh prompts for the base repo, or picks the wrong one, pin it:**
  `gh pr create --repo <upstream-owner>/<repo> --base main --fill`.
- **GitHub's API occasionally answers 5xx** (a `502 Bad Gateway` on
  `gh pr create` is not their fault) - just run the same command again.

Before pushing, a quick `git remote -v` confirms `origin` is **their** fork, not
the upstream - pushing to the wrong remote is the classic first-timer slip.

Walk them through each command if it is their first time. Then set expectations:
the maintainer reviews every exhibit personally and may ask for changes or
decline it - that is normal for a curated collection and says nothing about
their code.
