# C# Bad Practices

Ideal tutorials teach you SOLID. **Bad** code is remembered better.

> Museum stats: **5** exhibits in **4** halls, latest addition — **#0005**.

### 🗂 Collections

| # | Exhibit | Level | The pain |
|--:|---------|-------|----------|
| 0001 | [Modifying a collection while iterating](src/collections/0001-modify-while-enumerating/) | 🟢 | `foreach` + `Remove` on the same list — partial execution and a crash |
| 0004 | [Mutating a dictionary key](src/collections/0004-dictionary-key-mutation/) | 🟡 | change a field on the key — `foreach` still shows the entry, lookups can't find it |

### 🔢 Numbers

| # | Exhibit | Level | The pain |
|--:|---------|-------|----------|
| 0002 | [Calculating money with double](src/numbers/0002-doubles-for-money/) | 🟢 | `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` — binary floats can't hold decimal cents |

### ⚡ Async & Threading

| # | Exhibit | Level | The pain |
|--:|---------|-------|----------|
| 0003 | [Incrementing a shared counter from parallel threads](src/async/0003-race-on-shared-counter/) | 🟢 | `counter++` from two threads — thousands of increments quietly vanish. |

### 💥 Exceptions

| # | Exhibit | Level | The pain |
|--:|---------|-------|----------|
| 0005 | [Rethrowing with throw ex](src/exceptions/0005-throw-ex-stack-amnesia/) | 🟡 | `throw ex` wipes the stack trace — the investigation starts at the wrong line |

# To Be Continued

More halls under construction: **ORM**, **datetime**,
**strings & memory**, **DI lifetimes**, **security**.
